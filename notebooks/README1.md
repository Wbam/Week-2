# User Engagement Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing user engagement for telecom services. The goal is to evaluate user activity to enhance Quality of Service (QoS) and optimize resource allocation based on user engagement metrics. We will aggregate engagement metrics, normalize the data, apply clustering techniques, and analyze application usage.

## Objectives

1. **Track User Engagement**:

   - Analyze user sessions to measure engagement based on:
     - Session frequency
     - Duration of sessions
     - Total data traffic (download and upload)

2. **Metrics Analysis**:
   - Aggregate and report the top 10 users for each engagement metric.
   - Normalize engagement metrics and perform K-means clustering to classify users into engagement groups.
   - Compute and report summary statistics (min, max, average, total) for each cluster.
3. **Application Usage**:

   - Aggregate user traffic per application.
   - Identify and report the top 10 most engaged users per application.
   - Plot the top 3 most used applications using appropriate charts.

4. **Clustering Analysis**:
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method for K-means clustering.
   - Analyze and interpret the clustering results.

## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   - Load the cleaned dataset.
   - Define and aggregate engagement metrics per user.

2. **Analyze Engagement Metrics**:

   - Report top users for each metric.
   - Normalize the metrics.
   - Apply K-means clustering (k=3) to classify users into engagement groups.
   - Compute and interpret cluster statistics.

3. **Application Usage Analysis**:

   - Aggregate and analyze traffic data for different applications.
   - Identify top engaged users and plot the most used applications.

4. **Clustering Optimization**:
   - Use the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.
   - Analyze and interpret the clustering results.

## Dependencies
